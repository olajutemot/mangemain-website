## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

Welcome to this front-end coding challenge.

This challenge will help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the desktop design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

I have provided a basic markup for you in the HTML file, but you can tweak it anyway you want as long as the rendition on the frontend looks good.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized.

The fonts and colours have been listed in the style-guide.md

## Submitting your solution

To submit your solution, take the following steps:

1. create a repository on github and name it **manage**
2. push your code to the repository
3. invite **aydotjs** as a collaborator

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. I recommend:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
